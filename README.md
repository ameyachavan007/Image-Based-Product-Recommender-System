# Image-Based-Product-Recommender-System
An AI and Data Science project including a web scrapped dataset to perform visual search and recommend products from e-commerce websites.

## Dataset
We created our own dataset by scrapping product information from Amazon.com. For this purpose we used online free web scrapping tool called ParseHub.

## Research Work
Following 4 papers were studied for the creation of this project: 
* Farhan Ullah, Bofeng Zhang, and Rehan Ullah Khan, “Image-Based Service Recommendation System: A JPEG-Coefficient RFs Approach”,IEEE, 2020.
* Farhan Ullah, Bofeng Zhang, and Rehan Ullah Khan, “Image-Based Service Recommendation System: A JPEG-Coefficient RFs Approach”,IEEE, 2020.
